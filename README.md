# User interface customization for i3wm 

- There are currently 4 themes:
	- Nord light
	- Lunaria light
	- Sushi

## Presiquities

- Install the following packages:

	- **feh**: setting background images
	- **[Gogh](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/)** to change terminal theme
	- **lxappearance**: setting the fonts, and the gtk themes
	- **brightnessctl**: controlling the brightness keys
	- **polybar**: i3blocks alternative. Looks much nicer, also support customization better
	- **rofi**: dmenu alternative. You should install [rofi themes by adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) first
	- **[maestrogerardo's i3-gaps-deb](https://github.com/maestrogerardo/i3-gaps-deb)**: Debian does not support i3-gaps. Use this repo to setup i3-gaps for your Debian machine

## Folders
