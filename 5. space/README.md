# I3 Space

## Presiquities

- Install the following packages:

	- **feh**: setting background images.
	- **[Gogh](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/)**: to change terminal theme.
	- **lxappearance**: setting the fonts, and the gtk themes.
	- **brightnessctl**: controlling the brightness keys.
	- **Polybar**: i3blocks alternative. Looks much nicer, also support customization better.
	- **rofi**: dmenu alternative. You should install [rofi themes by adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) first.
	- **[maestrogerardo's i3-gaps-deb](https://github.com/maestrogerardo/i3-gaps-deb)**: Debian does not support i3-gaps. Use this repo to setup i3-gaps for your Debian machine.
	- **[Papirus Folders](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-folders)** as well as **[Papirus Nord](https://github.com/Adapta-Projects/Papirus-Nord)**: for icons themes. You can use whatever icons set you want though.
